Malaria is an infectious disease where parasites invade the bloodstream and take over your liver. Then, they begin multiplying in your blood cells, eventually killing you.

Malaria is spread through mosquito bites, or sometimes blood transfusions. it is most common in Africa and Asia, however, it can be found in places like Mexico and Brazil.
